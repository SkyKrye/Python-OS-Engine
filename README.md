# Python-OS-Engine
A small operating system type of python script that does things like make delete files stuff and more things you can do on a command line operating system i think.

It is known for being the most goofy thing I ever made with python, and it'll stay that way probably maybe I think
you can call it "pyTerminal", or "pyter Minimal"

## anyway these are some stuffs:
- can do basic commands
- file options like creating files with custom formats
- deleting any type of file, appending to them or writing one on your own
- cool things like usernames terminal names and passwords for doing stuffs
- making a huge cool document with some variable inputs
- print tools with tKinter and other `print()` tricks
- openecho
- cool calculator, credit to @megaboi2005
- MASSIVE neofetch clone (`infofetch`)
- **secret** commands

## these are the things i want to do:
- [ ] toggleable gui and cli modes
- [ ] extra extra extra commands
- [ ] a nice emulator for commands that powershell etc can do
- [ ] **more commands**
- [ ] picture/image recognition
- [ ] website emulation with ascii interfaces
- [ ] bark-it post integration
- [ ] custom commands
